20 points

Please feel free to use your previous lab assignments to help you complete the final. 

## Instructions
1. Create a repository called `gisc605-final` in your GitHub account (make sure it is public)
    1. Please use the [`github/codespaces-jupyter`](https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyter) repository as a template repository
3. Add a `README.md` file to your repository
    1. Please modify this file by adding your CSULB student email. Make sure to commit your changes to your repo. 
4. Add a file called `final_a.sh` to your repository
    1. Please write a bash script with a single function called `gisc605` that uses `echo` to output your CSULB username. Make sure to commit your changes to your repo. 
5. Add a file called `final_b.sh` to your repository
    1. Please write a bash script with list the contents of your `final_a.sh` script with `cat`. Make sure to commit your changes to your repo. 
8. Add a file called `final.ipynb` to your repository
    1. An alternative workflow is to use [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true) to create a Jupyter Notebook
    2. Write a function called `howdy_planet` that uses `print()` to output "Howdy Planet!" 
    3. In another code cell in the same notebook instantiate a variable called `directions` and set it equal to a list of the four cardinal directions: `["North", "South", "East", "West"]`
    4. Write a `for loop` that uses `print()` to output the contents of `directions`
    5. If using Codespaces, commit your changes.
    6. If using Colab, make sure to download your Jupyter Notebook and upload to your GitHub repo `gisc605-final`
